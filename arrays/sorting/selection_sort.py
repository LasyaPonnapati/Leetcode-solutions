# Selection Sort
# Given an array of integers nums, sort it in non-decreasing order
# using selection sort and return the sorted array.

# Approach:
# 1. Make n - 1 passes over the array (outer loop with i). After pass i, the
#    smallest remaining value sits at index i, so the left part nums[0..i] is sorted.
# 2. In the unsorted part nums[i..n-1], find the index of the smallest value.
# 3. Swap that value with nums[i] so it is placed in its correct position.
# 4. After all passes, return nums.

# Time Complexity: O(n^2) - the outer loop runs about n times, and each pass
# scans the remaining unsorted part (up to n elements) to find the minimum.
# Space Complexity: O(1) - sorting is done in place with a min index and swaps only.
